Shell Scripting Project – Squid Game Simulation

Created a mini command-line version of the Squid Game using Shell scripting, where users play a shape-guessing challenge inspired by the popular series. The game is text-based and runs entirely in the terminal, offering an interactive and time-bound experience. Players must guess randomly generated shapes within a limited time. Incorrect or delayed responses result in immediate termination of the game — mimicking the elimination style of the Squid Game.

--- Key Features and Functionalities: ---

Game Mode Selection:
Users can choose between different game modes (Easy, Medium, Hard), each with unique difficulty levels and response times.

Time-Limited Guessing:
A timer is implemented for each round. Players must guess the shape (such as circle, triangle, or square) before time runs out.

Randomized Shape Generation:
Shapes are randomly selected for each round to increase unpredictability and engagement.

Failure Handling:
The game ends if the user fails to provide the correct shape within the allotted time or enters an incorrect guess.

Terminal-Based Interface:
The entire game runs using core Unix shell scripting tools like read, sleep, trap, and conditionals.

Replay Option:
After each round, the user can choose to restart the game or exit.

This project demonstrates hands-on knowledge of Shell scripting concepts including loops, conditional logic, user input, timers, and basic game mechanics all implemented in a Unix environment.
